Npm i to download dependencies

Workingo on adding middleware to function to check for duplicates in the post router

Have deployed the database to AWS and AZURE but AZURE has caused the most issues when coming to launching the DB on a cloud service, so am sticking with AWS. Still working on launching the server because I have ran into issues with AWS ELB and will probably start from scratch and relaunch again but this is the current progress I have.
